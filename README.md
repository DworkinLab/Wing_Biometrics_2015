This is a repository for with all scripts and data for the paper:
Anne Sonnenschein; David VanderZee; William R. Pitchers; Sudarshan Chari; Ian Dworkin. (2015).An Image Database of **Drosophila melanogaster** Wings for Phenomic and Biometric analysis. GigaScience. http://dx.doi.org/10.5524/100141.  
The manuscript is available online (open access) [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.5524/100141)

All of the raw data (including images, landmark coordinate files, scripts and BioCat settings) are available on GigaDB. The temporary link is here (http://gigadb.org/dataset/view/id/100141/token/9RIJbfKlm1FQMW2e).


This repository includes

1. [Scripts used for the analyses in the paper.](https://github.com/DworkinLab/Wing_Biometrics_2015/tree/master/scripts)
2. [Landmark data used for  real study.](https://github.com/DworkinLab/Wing_Biometrics_2015/tree/master/data)
3. [Some old tutorials, practice data and run throughs](https://github.com/DworkinLab/Wing_Biometrics_2015/tree/master/Dworkin_machine_learning_in_R_tutorials) with practice data for lda, qda.
4. Maybe some easter eggs..
5. 
This work was funded by a[BEACON](beacon-center.org) funded project to Ian Dworkin to generate a database of images from the wings of *Drosophila melanogaster* to be used for biometric analysis. This repository contains scripts, some basic tutorials (for the students doing the project as well as everyone else) as well as landmark data.
